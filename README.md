# Neural Network cpp
Simple neural network in C++ from scratch.

I build a simple neural network in C++ from scratch. For Matrix operation I used the popular libary called Eigen.
The neural network class can initialized with as many layers and neurons as needed.
The weights of the neural network are initialized by the He-et-al method.
As the activation function the common sigmoid function is used.
The output layer of the Network is one-hot coded.
Backpropagation is used to train the network.

## Shit was my programming bad at this time...
